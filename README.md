## 📱 Device Support & AR Advice

- **Android:** Requires ARCore (unstable on some old/budget phones; flagship recommended)
- **iOS:** ARKit runs smoother, more stable, better for demo/showcase
- **Low-end devices:** Heavy models may crash; use small ones (e.g., “Box”, “Rubber Duck”)

---

## 📝 Known Issues

- AR performance may lag/crash on low-spec Android devices
- Cannot build release APK due to version conflicts/errors
- Materialization problems with some 3D models
- ARKit support (iOS) is generally smoother and updated more frequently
- Large/high-poly models can overload mobile hardware—optimize for best results
- The app works great as a furniture browser and 3D viewer even if AR is unavailable!
